To calculate the electricity generated by a photovoltaic (PV) system, you would need to consider various parameters. Here are some suggested values for the parameters you mentioned:

1. Power Peak: The power peak represents the maximum power output of the PV system under ideal conditions. The value depends on the capacity and efficiency of the PV panels you are using. For residential systems, typical power peak values range from 3 kW to 10 kW.

2. Orientation: The orientation of the PV panels refers to the direction they face. The optimal orientation depends on your location. For example, in the northern hemisphere, south-facing panels tend to receive the most sunlight throughout the day. However, east or west-facing orientations can also be considered to capture more morning or afternoon sunlight, respectively.

3. Inclination/Tilt: The inclination or tilt angle represents the angle at which the PV panels are installed relative to the horizontal plane. The optimal tilt angle depends on your latitude. As a rule of thumb, setting the tilt angle equal to the latitude is a good starting point. However, adjusting the tilt angle based on seasonal variations can help optimize energy production.

4. Area: The area refers to the total surface area of the PV panels. The size of the area depends on the available space and the capacity of the PV system. Typical residential PV systems can have an area ranging from 10 m² to 40 m².

5. Longitude and Latitude: The longitude and latitude values represent the geographic coordinates of the installation site. These values are necessary for accurate solar position calculations and accounting for regional variations in solar irradiance. Ensure that you input the precise coordinates of your location.

6. Clouds: Cloud cover affects the amount of solar radiation reaching the PV panels. It can vary significantly depending on the region and time of year. It's challenging to provide specific values for cloud cover since it's highly location-dependent. However, you can consider average cloud cover data for your area based on historical weather records or consult local meteorological sources.

7. System Loss: System loss accounts for various factors that reduce the overall efficiency of the PV system. It includes losses due to wiring, inverter efficiency, temperature effects, shading, soiling, and other factors. System losses can range from 10% to 30% depending on the specific system design and environmental conditions.

It's important to note that these suggested values are general guidelines, and the actual values can vary based on your specific requirements, site conditions, and the PV products you are using. For accurate and detailed calculations, it is recommended to consult with a professional solar installer or use specialized software tools that consider all relevant factors for your specific location.
